# iBeaconTool
iBeacon ranging results on chart

## Summary
iBeaconTool is a small app to help you work with iBeacons. It contains 2 modules:

* devices list - lists all devices and their estimated distance. To rescan, hit the refresh button on the top

* distance/time - line chart depicting how particular iBeacon assumed distance changed in time.


If you're just starting the iBeacon journey, it really helps to see how inaccurate they are. Better check this out before you spend hours trying to debug working code ;)


## Requirements
* iOS 8.0+
* works only on device 

## Roadmap

* add labels to beacons
* add tests
* ...

## Maintainer 

* Michal Zygar ([mzygar](https://github.com/mzygar))
